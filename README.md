# lancache-adblock
Generates an redirecting Adblock list for use with DNS blockers such as Adguard Home or Pi.Hole

You can either run it yourself in a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/nilsdahlback/lancache-adblock) or just add https://lancache-adblock.herokuapp.com/?ip= as a adblock list in either Adguard Home, Pi.Hole or whatever other service you are using.
